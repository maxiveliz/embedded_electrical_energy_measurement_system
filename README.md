Smart Meter Project


A novel High-Frequency Electric Energy Metering System to inspect non-conventional features that may be 
relevant for studying real-time energy disaggregation and control of household appliances, is presented.
Integration of a data acquisition and control board based on the M90E36A DB chip, designed and built to be
assembled with an Arduino DUE, allows for flexible and configurable electrical energy measurements. Samples
can be obtained and processed by the M90E36A IC internal DSP at 3 Hz in the time domain and 2 Hz in the
frequency domain. Furthermore, the M90E36A IC direct access memory mode can be operated, allowing 8 kHz
pure voltage and current signals to be obtained. Finally, integration with Raspberry Pi allows to design and
incorporate a custom signal processor into the study. Additionally, in this article, an application example is
presented where the variation of the residual harmonic components of a household appliance is obtained.
